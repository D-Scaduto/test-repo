2. Collect and add new data to database
3. Data gets sorted/changed (categories)
4. Define/decide distinct tabs for website (how will it look i.e. two products tabs)
5. Tester confirms new code with tools from Dev
	
6. Formating (certain google workbench things change the formating)
7. Config manager updates Live site.
